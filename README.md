Dynamics of Language Death

Language death is the phenomenon in which the speech communities witness a de- crease in the linguistic competence of its speakers, eventually leading to lesser lan- guage variety or no fluent speakers of that language. The influence of dominating languages on endangered ones slowly leads to the extinction of the lesser used lan- guages. It is estimated that 90% of the worldâ€™s languages will die with the current generation and no native speakers of that language will be left.
